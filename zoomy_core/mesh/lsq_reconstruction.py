    """Build per-cell LSQ gradient operators.

    Interior cells (index < ``n_inner_cells``) are used as neighbors.
    Boundary cells additionally include the boundary-face center(s)
    they touch as **virtual sampling positions** — the LSQ row at a
    boundary face contributes the BC-prescribed face value, so the
    cell-centered derivative is boundary-aware.  This is the
    ghost-cell-free analogue of "apply boundary_operator then take
    the gradient": the boundary face is a first-class entity in the
    mesh, sampled at distance ``|face_center − cell_center|`` (= dx/2
    in 1D, vs. dx for the legacy ghost-cell convention), so the
    boundary-face stencil is also tighter and more accurate.

    Stencil selection
    -----------------
    * When ``cell_vertices`` is provided (recommended for ≥2D),
      the per-cell stencil is the **full vertex-1-ring**: every
      inner cell sharing at least one vertex with the current cell.
      On a structured quad/triangle mesh this is geometrically
      symmetric around the cell centre (offset sum ≈ 0), giving
      O(h²) gradient accuracy at the cell centre on smooth fields.
    * When ``cell_vertices`` is None, the legacy face-neighbour +
      ``expand_neighbors`` iteration is used to fill the stencil.
      That path is symmetric in 1D but biased in 2D/3D — only kept
      for backward compatibility with callers that lack vertex
      topology.

    Parameters
    ----------
    boundary_face_centers : ndarray, shape ``(n_boundary_faces, dim)``, optional
        Face centers of all boundary faces.  Required when
        ``cell_boundary_faces`` provides any non-empty entry.
    cell_boundary_faces : sequence, length ``n_cells``, optional
        For each cell, the list of boundary-face indices touching that
        cell.  Empty list for interior cells.  When omitted, the
        stencil reduces to the legacy interior-only form.
    cell_vertices : ndarray, shape ``(verts_per_cell, n_cells)``, optional
        Vertex topology used to build a symmetric vertex-1-ring
        stencil.  Strongly recommended for 2D/3D meshes — without
        it the stencil is biased and gradient convergence drops to
        O(h).

    Returns
    -------
    A_glob : ``(n_cells, max_neighbors + max_bdy_per_cell, n_monomials)``
    neighbors_array : ``(n_cells, max_neighbors)`` int
