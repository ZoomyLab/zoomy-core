"""Canonical independent coordinates for the derivation framework.

These are *the* coordinate symbols every :class:`~zoomy_core.model.derivation.Model`
and the :mod:`zoomy_core.derivatives` helper share, so that ``d.t(f)``
differentiates with respect to the very same ``t`` the fields depend on.

    from zoomy_core import coords
    t, x, z = coords.t, coords.x, coords.z

Only the independent variables are fixed here — fields (``u``, ``p``, ``h`` …)
are declared freely by the user as ordinary ``sympy`` Functions.
