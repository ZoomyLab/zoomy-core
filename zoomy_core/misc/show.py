"""One display call that works in every environment a case is run in.

A case is executed in at least three places and they disagree about output:

* a **Jupyter / GUI kernel** — rich output, ``display`` is an IPython builtin;
* **plain** ``python case.py`` — there is no IPython at all, so ``display`` is
  simply undefined and a cell using it dies with ``NameError``;
* a **headless worker** — importable IPython may exist, but no kernel.

On top of that, sympy renders as LaTeX only through its ``_repr_latex_`` hook,
which is not reliably active: equations came out as plain text inside a
notebook.  Routing through ``IPython.display.Math(sympy.latex(...))`` renders
via MathJax unconditionally.

So cases call :func:`show` and stop carrying their own shim::

    from zoomy_core.misc.show import show

    show(model.describe())                      # any object
    show(eq=(sympy.Symbol("h^*"), h_expr))      # a rendered equation

Keeping this here rather than pasted into each case is the same rule the rest
of the framework follows: a case selects behaviour, it does not reimplement it.
