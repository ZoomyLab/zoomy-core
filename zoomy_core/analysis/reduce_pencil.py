"""Generic singular-pencil reduction for the principal-symbol problem.

When a linearised PDE system has algebraic constraint rows (M_t row =
zero), the principal-symbol pencil ``(M_x, M_t)`` is *singular* —
``det(M_x − λ M_t) ≡ 0`` and standard generalised-eigenvalue solvers
return garbage.

This module reduces a singular pencil to a regular one by repeatedly:

  1. Picking an algebraic row (``M_t`` row identically zero).
  2. Solving its M_x-row for one field (the field with the simplest
     non-zero coefficient in that row).
  3. Substituting that field's expression into every other row of
     ``M_x`` and ``M_t``, then dropping the row + the eliminated column.

After reduction (when no all-zero ``M_t`` row remains), the pencil is
regular and standard generalised-eigenvalue routines work.

The algorithm is *generic* — it works for any system with algebraic
constraints, regardless of the model.  It chooses elimination order by
"simplest coefficient first", which is deterministic but not unique;
the **finite eigenvalues are basis-invariant** under valid elimination
choices, so the result is independent of the order.

    Three classes of "algebraic" rows are handled:

      a) ``M_t row = 0`` and ``M_x row != 0`` — principal-symbol
         algebraic constraint at high k.  Use the M_x row to solve
         for one field and substitute into all remaining rows
         (M_x, M_t and M_0 if provided).

      b) ``M_t row = 0`` and ``M_x row = 0`` and ``M_0 row != 0`` —
         zeroth-order algebraic constraint (k-independent).  Use the
         M_0 row to solve.  REQUIRES ``M_0`` argument.

      c) All three rows zero — redundant; drop the row.

    Returns ``(M_x_reduced, M_t_reduced, fields_reduced)`` with no
    all-zero ``M_t`` rows.  If ``M_0`` was provided it is also
    reduced; access via the returned tuple's caller side-effect (the
