"""``ExternalProcedure`` — the third declaration kind (validation appendix D12).

``register_symbolic_function`` cannot carry the solver's opaque blocks: it
evaluates the body EAGERLY at registration (``basefunction.py``) and a ``None``
body yields a ZERO definition, and the ``kernel_functions`` externals are
expression-position scalar atoms.  The design's opaque blocks
(``prepare_mesh`` / ``mood_resolve`` / ``write_fields`` / the coupling
surfaces / …) are statement-position, side-effecting and handle-typed.

So: declare the NAME + SIGNATURE in core, supply the BODY per backend, and put
every declaration on :data:`REQUIRED_PROCEDURES` — the same contract shape
``REQUIRED_KERNELS`` (``kernel_functions.py``) already uses for the numerical
UserFunctions, so a backend missing a body is a RED TEST rather than a link
error mid-build (C++) or a ``NameError`` at lambdify (python).
