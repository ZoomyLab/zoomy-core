"""EMITTED march constants (design v7 / mandate 6a).

The user law is blunt: **no numerical constant is hard-coded in a backend**.
Every number the march compares against — the MOOD detector bound, the KP
wet/dry ``eps``, the eigenvalue-slot wave-speed floor ``eps_h``, the CFL
safety factor and its dimension/degree denominators, the write-cadence
tolerance and the (default-OFF) dt floor — is therefore RESOLVED FROM THE NSM
here and EMITTED as a named value at the head of the emitted procedure.

Consequence for the emitted code: a comparison site reads
``lam < c_eps_h``, never ``lam < 1e-14``.  The only place a float literal
survives is the ``Assign`` that DEFINES the named value, which is exactly what
"the constants are emitted" means.

Provenance, per constant
------------------------
``c_mood_h_bound``
    Strict ``0``.  The PAD predicate is ``h < 0`` — *detection*, never repair.
    The user law forbids flooring/clipping ``h``, so this bound is exactly
    zero and is NOT tunable; it is emitted so a backend cannot quietly widen
    it to ``-1e-12``.
``c_mood_require_finite``
    ``1`` when the CAD (non-finite) half of the troubled predicate is active.
    Emitted as a value rather than baked in so a backend that genuinely cannot
    test finiteness must turn it OFF explicitly and visibly.
``c_kp_eps``
    The Kurganov–Petrova desingularisation ``eps`` of ``hinv``.  Read from the
    model's REQ-48 ``wet_dry_eps`` parameter when it declares one, else
    :data:`zoomy_core.systemmodel.operations._DEFAULT_WET_DRY_EPS`.  Same
    resolution order ``desingularize_hinv`` itself uses — read, never
    re-decided.
``c_eps_h``
    The EIGENVALUE-SLOT wave-speed floor (REQ-82, user ruling cid=5).
    Recovered BY INSPECTION from ``nsm.eigenvalues``: ``regularize_pow``
    writes ``1/Max(Float(eps_h), h)`` into that slot, so the number is read
    back out of the derived operator rather than restated here.  If the slot
    carries no such floor (no ``h`` state, or no regularisation applied) the
    constant is emitted as ``None`` and no floor comparison is emitted at all.
``c_cfl``
    The CFL SAFETY FACTOR — the user law (0.9), a pure safety factor.  It is
    an input to the emit, not an NSM field, because it is a user ruling; it is
    never adjusted by the march and there is no dt-halving retry.
``c_cfl_dimension``
    The ``d`` of ``CFL*2r/(d*(2k+1)*|lam|)``.  The MESH dimension (user law:
    "pass dimension = the MESH dimension").
``c_cfl_degree_factor``
    ``2k+1`` for reconstruction degree ``k``.
``c_dt_max``
    ``nsm.dt_max`` (REQ-190): the cap every backend must read from the same
    place.  A wave-free domain steps at exactly this value.
``c_write_eps``
    The drift-free write-gate tolerance of ``should_write``
    (``time + c_write_eps >= i_snapshot*write_interval``).
``c_dt_floor``
    DEFAULT OFF (``None``).  When OFF, the ``dt_floor`` build flag is False
    and the emitted march contains NO floor comparison — the honesty guard is
    a FATAL abort on ``dt <= 0``, not a silent floor.
