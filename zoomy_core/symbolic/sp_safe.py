"""Held-form sympy constructors for the symbolic primitive layer.

Sympy's default constructors auto-evaluate where they can:
``sp.Derivative(x**2, x)`` returns ``2*x``, not a held atom.  This
auto-evaluation is the root of every "math fired at the wrong pipeline
position" bug we've hit — the framework can't keep an opaque atom
opaque if sympy decides to evaluate it on construction.

The constructors here always pass ``evaluate=False``.  Every primitive
in this package must use them when it constructs a fresh ``Derivative``,
``Integral`` or ``Subs`` atom.  A CI grep forbids bare ``sp.Derivative(...)``,
``sp.Integral(...)``, ``sp.diff(...)`` calls inside the symbolic
subpackage.

    -------
    sympy.Derivative

        decides when to apply chain/product/Leibniz rules.

    ``sp.Integral`` is held by default (it never auto-evaluates on
    construction), so this is a thin documenting wrapper.  Only
    ``.doit()`` or ``sp.integrate(...)`` would evaluate it — both are

    go through ``Sub`` and produce a held atom rendered as
    ``expr|_{var=value}`` by the latex printer.
