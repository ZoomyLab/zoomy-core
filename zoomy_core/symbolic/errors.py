"""Exceptions used by the symbolic primitive layer.

A primitive is a single, well-defined mathematical operation.  When the
caller invokes one whose preconditions don't match the input, the
primitive raises :class:`PrimitiveDoesNotMatch` rather than silently
no-op'ing or — worse — guessing.  This is the explicit failure mode
the redesign is built around: the caller must compose primitives with
matching preconditions, and any mistake becomes a loud exception
rather than a quiet wrong-form result.
