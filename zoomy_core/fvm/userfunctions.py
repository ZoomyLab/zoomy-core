"""NumPy backend **UserFunctions** — the concrete implementations of the opaque
:mod:`zoomy_core.model.kernel_functions` kernels for the numpy runtime.

This is numpy's ``UserFunctions`` table, the python mirror of the C++ backends'
``UserFunctions.H`` (REQ-168).  Every backend-supplied kernel named in
:data:`zoomy_core.model.kernel_functions.REQUIRED_KERNELS` has an entry in
:data:`KERNELS` here, so a missing kernel is a caught omission (see the contract
test) rather than a silent ``NameError`` at lambdify time.  ``to_numpy.module``
is built from these tables via :func:`numpy_module`.

Kept a leaf module (imports only numpy) so ``to_numpy`` can import it without a
``fvm`` ↔ ``transformation`` cycle.

Each kernel returns the WHOLE packed result of ONE decomposition / solve
(``eigensystem`` → ``[λ, R, L]``, ``eigenvalues`` → ``λ``, ``solve`` → ``A⁻¹b``);
component access is ``pick(K(*a), idx)``.  The producers emit every component
read against the SAME ``K(*a)`` node, so lambdify's cse hoists it to a single
call per face — R, |Λ| and L therefore come from ONE eigenbasis by construction
(``|A| = R|Λ|L`` consistent), with no per-call cache to keep them in sync.
