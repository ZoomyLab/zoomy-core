"""Symbolic numerics-control wrappers — applied at runtime by the solver.

These let the model author annotate PDE terms with a *requested numerical
treatment* (gradient limiter, reconstruction scheme, ...) without
exposing the user to the discretisation layer.  The wrappers are inert
sympy Functions that the operator-form pipeline recognises and routes
into ``aux_registry`` entries with extra metadata fields.

The OpenFOAM analogue: ``fvSchemes`` exposes a scheme dictionary that
the user fills in per term (``div(phi,U)``, ``grad(p)``, ``laplacian(nu,U)``
each get their own scheme).  Our equivalent: the model author writes the
PDE in operator-form using these wrappers, and the runtime resolves
each one against the configured discretisation.

Currently exposed
-----------------

``limit(expr, scheme_symbol)``
    Wrap a gradient/derivative atom with a runtime TVD limiter.  The
    second argument is a ``sp.Symbol`` whose name names the scheme
    (``"minmod"``, ``"venkatakrishnan"``, ``"barth_jespersen"``).  At
    runtime, ``compute_derivatives`` first computes the unlimited LSQ
    gradient, then applies the named limiter per cell, and substitutes
    the limited value into the source expression.

Usage example
-------------

::

    from zoomy_core.model.numerics import limit
    import sympy as sp

    h = sp.Symbol("h")
    x = sp.Symbol("x")
    minmod = sp.Symbol("minmod")
    S[1, 0] = - 2 * P_1 * limit(sp.Derivative(b, x), minmod)

    """Symbolic gradient-limiter wrapper.

    Signature::

        limit(expr, scheme)

    where ``expr`` is the derivative atom to be limited at runtime
    (typically a ``sp.Derivative`` of a state/aux field), and ``scheme``
    is a ``sp.Symbol`` whose name selects the limiter
    (``"minmod"``, ``"venkatakrishnan"``, ``"barth_jespersen"``).

    The operator-form pipeline picks these up in ``expose_aux_atoms``
    and substitutes a fresh aux Symbol named ``{target}_{axes}__{scheme}``
    (e.g. ``b_x__minmod``).  The chain solver's aux refresh recomputes
    the LSQ gradient and applies the named limiter before the source
    expression is evaluated.

    Inert symbolically — ``.doit()`` does NOT strip the wrapper (the
    runtime needs to see it).
