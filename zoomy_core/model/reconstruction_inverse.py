"""Symbolic inverse of the reconstruction-variables map.

Given a forward map ``wb_k = f_k(state)`` (one entry per state slot,
as ZArray), :func:`invert_reconstruction` returns the closed-form
inverse ``state_k = g_k(WB)``, where ``WB`` is a vector of fresh
``WB_<state_name>`` symbols.  The inverse is auto-derived via
``sympy.solve``; topological ordering between slots (e.g. depth-first,
then momentum) is left to sympy.  Used by both
:meth:`zoomy_core.model.basemodel.Model.state_from_reconstruction`
and the corresponding SystemModel-level derived field, so the same
inverse logic is shared symbol-by-symbol whether invoked on the
model's primitive state or on the SystemModel's post-CoV state.
