"""Residual → operator structural extraction for the declarative
:class:`~zoomy_core.model.derivation.model.Model`.

The clean-redesign :class:`Model` carries plain sympy residuals in Function
form (``h(t, x)``, ``q(k, t, x)``) with NO solver tags.  Its equations are
nonetheless bit-exact to production (:class:`zoomy_core.model.models.sme.SME`)
and — after step 8b of the SME pipeline — bundled in production's K&T (4.17)
form: the conservative flux + hydrostatic-pressure divergences fold into
``∂_x(F)`` / ``∂_x(g h²/2)`` units, while the genuinely non-conservative
couplings (the bed ``g·h·∂_x b`` and the cross-mode ``q_i/h·∂_x q_j`` terms)
stay UNFOLDED.

``SystemModel.from_model(model, Q, Qaux)`` therefore extracts the operators by
feeding each residual — rewritten from Function form into the state Symbols —
through the SAME term classifier production uses
(:func:`zoomy_core.model.derivation.tag_extraction._classify_term`).  Per additive
term:

* ``Derivative(*, t)``                          → ``mass_matrix`` (coeff of
  the ``∂_t Q_j`` it carries);
* ``coeff · Derivative(F(Q), x)``, state-free
  coeff, gravity inside                         → ``hydrostatic_pressure``;
* ``coeff · Derivative(F(Q), x)``, state-free
  coeff, no gravity                             → ``flux``;
* ``coeff · Derivative(Q_j, x)``                → ``nonconservative_matrix``
  (``B[row, j]`` += coeff);
* ``coeff(Q) · Derivative(F(Q), x)`` with a
  state-dependent coeff                         → ``nonconservative_matrix``
  (recovered via the ``∂_x q_j`` couplings it expands into);
* everything else (no spatial derivative)       → ``source`` (sign-flipped).

Second-order ``∂_x(coeff · ∂_x Q_j)`` terms are routed to the rank-4
``diffusion_matrix`` (the diffusive flux ``Fᵈ = A(Q)∇Q``) — see the Newtonian
normal-stress variant.

``Q`` ∪ ``Qaux`` must cover every field atom; otherwise a ``ValueError`` names
the uncovered fields.
