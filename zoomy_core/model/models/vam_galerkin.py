"""VAMModelGalerkin — VAM derived via the explicit Galerkin chain.

Inherits from :class:`VAMModel` to keep the existing solver-compatible
state structure (``[b, h, hu_k, hw_k, hp_k]``, conservative form,
``M = I``) and the operator-API method bodies that downstream
runtimes depend on.  Adds:

1. A `derive_model` that **also** runs the explicit symbolic chain
   from ``zoomy_core.model.models.ins_generator`` —
   ``Multiply`` (Galerkin test) → ``Integrate`` (depth) →
   ``InterfaceKBC`` × 2 → atmospheric pressure → ``AffineProjection``
   → three ``Expand``s (u/w/p) → ``EvaluateIntegrals`` — producing a
   fully closed primitive-form derived `System` saved as
   ``self._chain_system`` for inspection via ``describe``.

2. ``self._chain_intermediate`` — the same derivation snapshot
   stopped right after the three ``Expand`` calls, before
   ``EvaluateIntegrals`` resolves them.  Carries the unevaluated
   ``sp.Sum`` form of the ansatz substitution so a walkthrough can
   render the paper-notation intermediate.

Today the chain output (primitive form: ``∂_t (U_k h) + …``) and the
conservative-form operator surface (``flux / NCP / source / mass``
extracted via ``DerivedModel`` machinery and consumed by solvers) are
two **mathematically equivalent** representations of the same model.
The chain documents the derivation; the inherited operator path
delivers the canonical M=I matrices the numerical solver needs.
A separate workstream will collapse them — re-doing the operator
extraction directly from the chain's tagged equations after a
primitive→conservative substitution + author-side tagging.  Until
then: derivation is shown, operators are correct, numerics run.
