"""Zoomy plotting style — RE-EXPORT shim.

The canonical style lives in ``zoomy_plotting.plot.style`` (the published
plotting package, decision 2026-06-11/B): Okabe–Ito palette + semantic
colors, marker rotation, print/screen profiles, the below-figure
``figure_legend``.  This module preserves the historical import path
``zoomy_core.postprocessing.style``.
