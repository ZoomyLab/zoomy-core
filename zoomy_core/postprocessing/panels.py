"""Composable single-axes plotting building blocks — RE-EXPORT shim.

The canonical implementations live in ``zoomy_plotting.plot.panels`` (the
published plotting package). This module preserves a stable import path
``zoomy_core.postprocessing.panels`` so thesis/tutorial drivers can drop
these blocks into ``plt.subplots`` / ``plt.subplot_mosaic`` layouts:

    from zoomy_core.postprocessing.panels import (
        line_plot, profile_plot, row_legend,
    )

Mirrors the ``zoomy_core.postprocessing.style`` shim.
