"""NumericalSystemModel — numerical sibling of :class:`SystemModel`.

The NSM bundles a frozen :class:`SystemModel` with everything a solver
needs that is *not* symbolic-PDE-shaped:

    - the Riemann-solver class (a :class:`Numerics` subclass)
    - the LSQ reconstruction spec (order, limiter)
    - the diffusion-scheme spec (Crank-Nicolson, ν override, …)
    - numerical regularization (eigenvalue eps, …)
    - the LSQ polynomial degree (auto-derived from the SystemModel's
      ``aux_registry`` when not pinned explicitly)

This means a solver constructor no longer takes a pile of
``(model, riemann=, reconstruction_order=, eigenvalue_regularization=,
…)`` kwargs.  Solvers consume the NSM directly; everything else is a
runtime knob (dt control, end time, IO, GMRES tolerances).

The class is **read-only** on the contained :class:`SystemModel` — it
never mutates the symbolic operators.  Two reasons:

1. Other agents may be revisiting ``SystemModel`` concurrently; we keep
   the seam clean by leaving the symbolic frozen-form untouched.
2. Numerical operations (regularization, field-inversion-into-aux,
   splitting into sub-systems) belong on the NSM, not on the symbolic
   sibling — mirrors the user's mental model that *numerical*
   transformations operate on a *numerical* container.

    Why this is a construction and not a repair pass.  The Model declares
    physical facts on its field heads (``h = Function("h", positive=True)``).
    The SystemModel MUST keep them: that is where the analytic spectrum is
    computed and sympy needs ``h > 0`` to collapse ``sqrt(h**5)/h**2`` into
    ``sqrt(h)``.  The NSM must NOT have them: an assumption there lets sympy
    delete a numerical guard as a tautology.

    ``from_system_model`` used to RE-CLASS the SystemModel in place
    (``sm.__class__ = cls``), so the two layers shared one object and one symbol
    space and the invariant had to be enforced by hunting an object graph.  That
    is unbounded and fails SILENTLY -- a missed slot leaves a symbol that PRINTS
    IDENTICALLY to its twin and compares unequal.  It was attempted three times:
    a 13-name sweep missed ``reconstruction_variables``/``interpolate_to_3d``
    and broke every foam SME emission (cid=87); a widened tuple missed ``hinv``
    (registered by ``desingularize_hinv`` INSIDE ``derive()``, after any seam) --
    113 sites in ML-VAM; a full type walk broke every model build.

    Constructing inverts the question from "did I reach every slot?" (unbounded,
    silent) to "did I copy every field?" (bounded, and a miss raises).  And
    ``derive()`` then runs in NSM symbol space from the start, so anything IT
    registers is already correct -- the ``hinv`` class of bug stops existing
    rather than being patched.

    The field set comes from ``operations.OPERATOR_SLOTS``, the canonical
    registry with a documented "opt OUT, never opt in" rule -- never a literal
    written here.  That registry is what contains ``interpolate_to_3d`` and

       operator, which reaches neighbours by construction.  Gated on
       ``diffusion.enabled`` because that flag is what decides whether the
       diffusion stage runs at all.
    2. **A live implicit source that reads a non-local aux is coupled too.**
       ``source`` is the ``implicit_source``-tagged slot.  "Source" names where
       a term sits in the equation, NOT its stencil: a source that reads an LSQ
       gradient row couples cells exactly as a diffusion operator does, and
       inverting it per cell would be wrong.  This is the case a
       declared-by-hand flag gets wrong, which is why the mode is derived.

       entry is a function of this cell's state and pointwise aux, so the stage
       is N independent small nonlinear solves.
    4. **Nothing live ⇒ no implicit stage.**

    Note what falls out of rule 1 + rule 2: a model with BOTH implicit
    diffusion and an implicit source reports ``coupled`` — ONE stage solve
    carrying both operators, never two separate solves.  The Lie split the

        This is a property of the **(model × Riemann-solver × current
        representation)** triple, NOT of the model's
        ``nonconservative_matrix``, and it is deliberately re-read on every
        access rather than cached.  Both halves of that sentence were
        MEASURED, and both directions of the naive model-only test are wrong:

        * **A non-zero model NCP does not imply a fluctuation.**  2-D SWE
          carries ``B[hu][b] = B[hv][b] = g·h`` (bed slope, because ``b`` is
          in the state), yet under :class:`PositiveRusanov` all eight emitted
          entries are literal zero.  Note the mechanism, because it is not
          the one the name suggests: ``PositiveRusanov`` does not take a path
          integral over ``B`` at all — its fluctuation is the Audusse
          consistency term ``S̃ = P_raw − P*`` built from
          ``hydrostatic_pressure``.  The hand-built ``SWE`` model states its
          operators directly and lumps ``g·h²/2`` into ``flux``, leaving the
          ``hydrostatic_pressure`` slot ZERO — so ``S̃`` is structurally
          ABSENT, not cancelling.  (Derived models put ``P = g·h²/2`` in the
          P slot, and their ``S̃`` is alive: SME×PositiveRusanov is
          well-balanced; the hand-built SWE×PositiveRusanov is NOT
          well-balanced standalone — measured ``d(hu)/dt = 1.77`` on a
          sloping-bed lake at rest — and relies on a driver-side bed-source
          pair, cf. REQ-210/211.)  The model NCP is not merely a poor proxy
          here; it is a different operator.  Deciding from it would block
          the conservative fast path on a system that is conservative as
          emitted.
          ⚠ ``fluctuations_are_zero == True`` therefore does NOT mean
          "needs no bed treatment" — it means exactly and only that no
          fluctuation term is computed.
        * **A zero model NCP does not imply no fluctuation.**  ``Rusanov`` /
          ``HLL`` / ``HLLC`` never override ``numerical_fluctuations`` and so
          inherit the identically-zero base, while the nonconservative
          variants build one out of the same model.

        The same ``PositiveRusanov`` cancellation is also model-specific, so
        the answer cannot be keyed on the Riemann class either: it holds for
        SWE (0/8 entries non-zero) but not for SME (2/8) or VAM (2/16),
        whose richer pressure rows leave a residue.

        The value also moves with the REPRESENTATION, which is why it is not
        cached: ``RemoveNonDiagonalH`` CREATES a fluctuation and
        ``HydrostaticReconstruction`` erases one, and both arrive through
        :meth:`apply` long after construction.

        The criterion itself lives in :func:`numerics_fluctuations_are_zero`
        so that a printer holding its OWN numerics can apply the same test to
        that object — one criterion, one implementation, no re-derivation at

        * the presence of a depth state ``h`` — non-shallow-water systems
          (no ``h``) get nothing.

        Non-default behaviour still rides on opt-in :attr:`extra_operations`.

        REQ-194 adds four construction-time axes on top, each defaulting to
        today's behaviour so a caller that passes nothing gets exactly
        ``[desingularize_hinv()]`` as before.  The ORDER below is load-bearing:

        1. :func:`normalize_face_normal` (``normalize_normal=True``) — must run
           BEFORE any reciprocal rewrite, since it is what splits the celerity
           out of the spectrum's common denominator; afterwards the split can no
           longer happen because the reciprocal is already opaque.
        2. the depth regularization selected by :attr:`depth_regularization`.
        3. the eigenvalue guard selected by :attr:`eigenvalue_guard` — after the
           regularization, because it wraps whatever reciprocal step 2 left in
           the spectrum.
