"""Reusable :meth:`SystemModel.apply` operations.

These are plain callables ``op(system_model)`` consumed through the generic
:meth:`zoomy_core.systemmodel.SystemModel.apply` hook::

    sm.apply(register_aux("hinv", kp_hinv(h, eps)))
    sm.apply(regularize_pow("h", "hinv"))

They replace the per-case "system surgery" a model wrapper used to hand-roll
(walk every operator, substitute, append to ``aux_state``, hand-build a
full-length ``update_aux_variables``, call ``refresh_derived_operators``).  Each
operation owns its own refresh, so callers chain them and never touch the
derived-operator slots by hand.

SCOPING RULE (REQ-194).  The operations added for the depth-law study route
their rewrite through :func:`map_operator_slots`, which applies to **ALL**
operator slots (:data:`OPERATOR_SLOTS`) by DEFAULT.  An operation that must not
touch a slot declares an explicit ``exclude=(...)`` with a stated reason, and a
name that is not a member of the registry RAISES.  Opt OUT, never opt in —
dropping a slot from coverage is then a deliberate, visible decision rather than
an omission.  (The predecessor was a closed hard-coded list of 14 slot names
iterated with ``getattr(sm, nm, None)``, so ``interpolate_to_3d`` kept a bare
``hu/h`` and the boundary-condition kernels were never reached at all —
silently.)

The LEGACY pair :func:`register_aux` + :func:`regularize_pow` (and their
composition :func:`desingularize_hinv`, which is still the NSM depth default) is
deliberately left on its old closed list so every backend that already opted
into it keeps emitting byte-identical code.  The study paths
(:func:`regularize_depth_direct` / :func:`regularize_depth_aux`) are the swept
ones.

# ── unit face normal ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────

def _unit_normal_rewrite(normal_syms):
    """Return ``rewrite(expr)`` imposing ``|n| = 1`` on the face normal.

    The face normal is a unit vector BY DEFINITION — every mesh in the project
    normalises it (``mesh_util._face_normals_*`` divide by ``np.linalg.norm``;
    in 1-D ``n0 = ±1``).  sympy has no way to know that, so it carries
    ``√(n0² + n1²)`` symbolically, which holds the 2-D spectrum over a common
    denominator and blocks every subsequent simplification::

        (√g·h^{3/2}·√(n0²+n1²) + hu·n0 + hv·n1) / h

    Imposing the relation and re-expanding splits it into the physical form::

        √(g·h) + hu·n0/h + hv·n1/h

    — after which ``1/h`` sits ONLY on the momentum terms and the celerity
    ``√(g·h)`` is structurally separate, so a later ``1/h`` regularization can
    never reach (and never damp) the wave speed.

    NB this separation is a property of the SWE spectrum, NOT a general fact.
    The SME spectrum is ``hinv·(n0·q_0 ± n0·√(g·h³ + q_1²))``: there the
    reciprocal multiplies the celerity and ``√(g·h³ + q_1²)`` does not factor,
    so normalising the normal does NOT take the regularization off the wave
    speed.  Which of the two behaviours the eigenvalues should get is the open
    question this machinery exists to measure — see the ``eigenvalues=`` axis of
    :func:`regularize_depth_direct` / :func:`regularize_depth_aux`.

    Rewrite rules, valid for ANY dimension:

    * ``(Σ_d n_d²)**k → 1``  for every exponent ``k`` (covers ``√(n0²+n1²)``,
      ``(n0²+n1²)^{3/2}``, ``1/(n0²+n1²)``, …);
    * the bare node ``Σ_d n_d² → 1``;
    * 1-D, where ``Σ n_d² = n0²`` collapses under sympy's own power algebra:
      ``n0**k → n0**(k mod 2)`` for integer ``k ∉ {0, 1}``, and ``|n0| → 1``.

    ``sp.expand`` afterwards is what makes the simplification FIRE (and is the
    only post-processing needed — ``powsimp`` / ``cancel`` are no-ops here: with
    ``g`` positive and ``h`` nonnegative, ``√g·√h`` IS sympy's canonical form of
    ``√(g·h)``, same ``srepr``).  It runs only on entries the relation actually
    changed, so a normal-free operator costs nothing.

#     every operator and its ``h``-derivative is exact wherever a Jacobian was
#     frozen before the substitution.
#   * AUX    — the reciprocal is promoted to an ``hinv`` aux row whose update
#     rule IS the KP expression, and the operators then carry ``hinv**n``.  One
#     named place holds the regularization; the operators stay small and

# whose ``hinv`` row and inline forms disagree), and nothing downstream could

    every Jacobian entry.  So the derived operators are frozen from the clean
    primaries and substituted, never refreshed.

    The only carve-out is a ROW-level self-reference guard rather than a slot
    exclusion: the ``update_aux_variables`` row that DEFINES ``name`` is left
    alone, since rewriting it would produce the tautology ``hinv = hinv`` and
    lose the formula entirely.

    When the model already declares the aux (e.g. MalpassetSWE), it must carry a
    REAL formula — a bare identity passthrough raises rather than letting the
    swept operators read an uncomputed slot.

# * ``gate_eigenvalues_dry()`` — B, the dry zeroing: wrap each eigenvalue in

#   branchless (``mask*a + (1-mask)*b``) computes BOTH arms and ``NaN*0 = NaN``
#   would leak a ``sqrt(negative)`` past the gate (REQ-74), the dry gate MUST
#   carry the power guard — so ``gate_eigenvalues_dry`` applies A internally
#   before the ``conditional``.  It therefore reproduces the pre-split combined
#   op BYTE-FOR-BYTE as a single op, and the explicit composition
#   ``[guard_eigenvalue_powers(), gate_eigenvalues_dry()]`` reproduces it too
