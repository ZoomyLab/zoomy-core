"""The ONE IMEX runtime small (spec v3 delta, §E1 ruling).

The IMEX solver otherwise loses ALL runtime coverage in the reduced suite
(retain_viscous march + imex_global both deleted).  One smoke: a real
``IMEXSolver`` step on SME(1) friction stays finite on BOTH source modes —
including ``source_mode='global'``, whose Newton-GMRES JVP path was completely
dead (TypeError on the first JVP) until REQ-144 threaded the numeric
parameters through.
