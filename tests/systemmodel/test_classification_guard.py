"""Classification-completeness guard (cid-182 follow-up).

The structural extractor routes every additive residual term into a slot
(``M / F / P / B / A / S``).  A term that matches NO branch is a SILENT DROP —
the class of bug that hid the VAM bed-slope ``∂_x(A·∂_x b)`` for weeks.  The
guard is a TERM-CONSERVATION check: reassemble each row from the slots it was
routed to and subtract the original residual; a nonzero remainder is a dropped
term.  It is generic (balance-law algebra only, no per-system knowledge) and is
enforced two ways:

* a warning on ``from_model`` by default, and
* the opt-in strict :meth:`SystemModel.assert_all_classified`.

These tests pin (a) the guard is SILENT on the healthy families — an empty
remainder is a hard requirement, a trip here is a real finding — and (b) it
CATCHES a deliberately dropped term (a classifier branch made to fail to route),
surfacing it in ``describe(full=True)`` and failing ``assert_all_classified``.
